If you can't run logSplitter.py you're missing the deap library
install it with: pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy "eager" --force-reinstall --ignore-installed --compile --process-dependency-links --no-binary :all: deap


Parameters to control the program behavior exist in the main of logSplitter, try playing with those
Parameters to control the log initialization are in the beginning of logArray, they seem to make a difference too
